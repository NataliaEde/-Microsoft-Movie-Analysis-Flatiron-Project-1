### Project Goal

In this project, Microsoft is establishing a new movie studio. I will use data analysis to advise Microsoft Studio (“MS”) toward a business plan that will increase gross domestic revenue.  
 
 
### Data Source and Data Exploration

This data derives from three largest available online databases – IMBd, The numbers, and Mojo Box office – from the years 2010-2018. During this time period, successful movie studios accumulated more than 100 billion dollars, a testament to the growing public interest in film culture and industry. 

### Method 

The analysis was coded using Python - focusing on Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib visualization. 
 
 
My data consisted of 15 columns and 13,376 rows. 
 
### Conclusion: 

I have determined that the best predictors of profitability for a given film are budget, release month, genre, cast and crew and movie length.

Budget: Budgets as low as 15 to 35 million dollars show an increase in the movie’s gross domestic, but a budget above 200 million dollars does not show the same rate of return. Do not exceed 200 million dollars.

Release Month: Aim to release the movie in June or November; if not, then in December, July, May. June and November bring twice as much gross domestic as the other months.

Genres: Prioritize the production of Adventure, Action, Comedy, and Sci Fi movies, as these genres are the top performers.

Cast and Crew: Hire from the top performing cast and crew to increase chances for success. Certain names are associated with the most successful movies.

Movie Length: Produce movies that would range from 90 minutes to 140 minutes. Movies within this length of time are the most profitable.

Studios: Partner with established studios to produce movies, at least for the first year. This is a long-term investment that can lead to fruitful returns and greater independence in the future.
